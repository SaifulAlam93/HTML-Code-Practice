<h1>North America</h1>	
	<p><h3>North America has been home to Muslims for a long time</h3>
Muslims first arrived in North America centuries before Columbus due to trading expeditions with Native Americans. After Columbus, the slave trade transported African Muslim slaves, who retained their spiritual practice and religious identity, to the Americas.

Over the next few centuries, Muslim migrants from all over the world settled in the New World in search of personal goals, such as education or employment. While some dreamed of returning “home” one day, the subsequent generations largely knew no other place but the United States or Canada as their home.</p>
	
	
	<h1>Islam in Europe: A Forgotten Legacy</h1>
	<p><h3>XRethinking European history</h3>
When we study European history, it generally traces the roots of Western civilization to the Greeks and Romans, followed by a dark period called the Middle Ages in which Europe languished in gloom. We are told that this bleak era eventually gave way to the Renaissance after Europeans rediscovered their classical Greek and Roman scholarship. This movement became the precursor to the modern world as we know it today: progressive, technological, scientific – perpetuating the widely-held notion that almost all great inventions have had their origins in the Western world.

Yet, this narrative of history doesn’t answer many crucial questions: Was all of Europe covered with a dark cloud during the Middle Ages? How was the rest of the world faring at the same time – did any inventions take place in any other part of the world or Europe? How did the Europeans rediscover their classical roots? How did this regained scholarship enable Europe to emerge out of darkness and achieve all the greatness that it has?

This is where another – seemingly disconnected – history steps in. It is an account that neatly fills in all the missing gaps and crevices in the history of Europe as it is taught – yet, sadly, this record is usually expunged from history books</p>
	
	
	<h1>Islam in Asia </h1>
	<p><h3>The diversity of Muslims in Asia</h3>
From the Middle East to southeastern Asia, from central Asia to the Pacific Islands, the diversity in Asia is striking. Yet, despite cultural differences, the religion of Islam forms a common thread across Asia. The majority of people in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Indonesia, to name just a few, find commonality in their practice of Islam while preserving their unique heritages.

Islam originated in the Arabian Peninsula and it was embraced by the people of various Asian regions over many centuries. Contact with Muslims came via trade, conquest, and intermarriages with the earliest Muslims. However, the mass acceptance of Islam took root over generations and through sustained interaction. Today, Islam is the largest religion of Asia.

<h3>Peaceful coexistence in Asia</h3>
Pockets of minorities continue to exist in Muslim Asian countries to this day. Muslims themselves form sizable minorities in many Asian countries such as India, China, Russia, and Japan. Ordinary citizens, irrespective of faith or culture, continue to coexist and intermingle peacefully in Muslim and non-Muslim countries in Asia, untouched by the rising tide of religious or secular extremism prevalent in the current world milieu.

In this section, we share the historic legacy of Baghdad, the peaceful and gradual introduction of Islam in Indonesia, and the story of the minority of Muslims living in China.</p>
	
	
	
	<h1>Islam in Africa</h1>
<h3></h3>
	<p>Islam’s presence in African history dates back to the first phase of the Prophet Muhammad’s mission, when in 615 A.D. he instructed a group of Muslims to seek refuge in Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia).

While this was a short-lived encounter, Muslims eventually left a lasting influence in North Africa which has since spread to western, eastern, and central Africa. In southern Africa, Muslims are tiny but vibrant minorities. Over the centuries, Muslims have made significant contributions to Africa as we know it.

Africa enjoyed unparalleled scholarship and intellectual revival under Muslim rule. Cities such as Cairo, Timbuktu, and Kairouan were academic and cultural hubs which attracted scholars and travelers alike. Today, Cairo houses the world’s second-oldest university, Al-Azhar, and the latter two are UNESCO World Heritage sites. Each of these cities is profiled in this section, complete with historical and intellectual overviews.

Renowned Muslims such as Saladin, Ibn Battuta, and Ibn Khaldun were all linked to Africa by residence or birth and contributed greatly to the traditions of heroism, traveling, and social sciences, respectively. A brief biography of each personality is presented in this section, with a focus on their individual achievements.

Islam has had a lasting impact on Africa, affecting its languages, architecture, and culture. Furthermore, contrary to the conventional belief that a predominantly oral culture has always existed in Africa, a rich literate culture thrived among Africans historically – going back as far as a millennium.

Recently discovered Arabic manuscripts, which had been passed on through descendants for centuries, have proven this beyond a shadow of doubt. In fact, John Hunwick and R.S. O’Fahey are currently collecting them in a comprehensive six-volume series called Arabic Literature of Africa; four of the six volumes have already been published. An article linked below gives details regarding this monumental project.

Lastly, there is emerging mainstream acknowledgement that Islam first came to America through African slaves. Many of these slaves were literate and continued to secretly practice their religion, as in the prominent example of Omar ibn Said. Sylviane Diouf explores their lives in Servants of Allah: African Muslims Enslaved in the Americas, an excerpt from which is included in this section.

In conclusion, Islam had an enduring influence both in Africa and in the lives of the African diaspora, as clearly exhibited through the various articles in this section.
